# Versions and Releases
Symphony Open Source projects are released to maven central for major and minor releases.
Patch releases are distributed internally to Symphony.

The **master** branch of the source repository represents the current minor (public) version.
The **dev** branch represents the current patch (internal) version.

In order to build and use the **dev** branch you need to have credentials for the Symphony internal distribution repos
in your **settings.xml** file. If you are a Symphony employee, search for "Open Source Libraries" in Confluence for details.
